Outlining my non-published projects here (open source contributions, course research projects, designed homeworks). My research work can be seen [here](/research/).

#### **Open-Source Projects**

[Argos](https://github.com/GDGVIT/Priority-Msg-Bot): Highly optimized (< 100ms latency) ML-powered Telegram bot to prevent notification pollution.

[Quicktext](https://github.com/GDGVIT/quicktext): An extremely quick (< 7 LOC) library to train text classification models; built on top of sPacy.

[Picturate](https://github.com/picturate/picturate) - A foundry offering modular and extensible components for building GAN based text-to-image models.

[Perception](https://github.com/ramaneswaran/perception) - A comprehensive reference implementation for large-scale unsupervised image search.

<!-- [Inference Networks for Structured Prediction](https://github.com/TheShadow29/infnet-spen) - A TensorFlow implementation for the multi-label classification experiments in [Learning Approximate Inference Networks for Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03376). Also contains experiments on the [FIGMENT](http://cistern.cis.lmu.de/figment/) dataset and a extension to Inference Network training algorithm based on [Wasserstein GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028) ([report](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalpesh/infnet.pdf)).

[Diversity Sampling in Machine Learning](http://github.com/martiansideofthemoon/diversity-sampling) - An implementation of [Diverse Beam Search for Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02424) in Language Modelling. Also contains the original (slightly modified code) for the interactive segmentation experiments in [Diverse M-Best Solutions in MRFs](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~gregory/papers/MBestModes.pdf) ([report](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalpesh/diversity.pdf)).

[Macro Actions in Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon/macro-action-rl) - A suite of five algorithms (including ideas from "[Learning to Repeat: Fine Grained Action Repetition for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06054)") encouraging agents to repeat actions ([report](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalpesh/macro.pdf)).

[Single Image Haze Removal](https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon/blind-dehazing) - An implementation of He et al. 2009, "[Single Image Haze Removal using Dark Channel Prior](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/rg/papers/hazeremoval.pdf)" and an ongoing implementation of Bahat & Irani 2016, "[Blind Dehazing using Internal Patch Recurrence](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7492870/)" ([report](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalpesh/dehaze.pdf)).

[CNNs for Sentence Classification](https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon/tf-sentence-classification) - A TensorFlow 1.1 implementation of Kim 2014, "[Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882)".  

[Brittle Fracture Simulation](https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon/brittle-fracture-simulation) - Python implementation of O'Brien and Hodgins 1999, "[Graphical Modeling and Animation of Brittle Fracture](http://graphics.berkeley.edu/papers/Obrien-GMA-1999-08/Obrien-GMA-1999-08.pdf)".

#### **Indian Language Datasets**

As a part of my RnD project at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), I am releasing the dataset used to train my neural network language models. These have been mined from Wikipedia and I hope this will help further research in language modelling for Indian morphologically rich languages. The folder also contains the original PTB dataset.

* Malayalam (denoted by `ml`)
* Tamil (denoted by `ta`)
* Kannada (denoted by `kn`)
* Telugu (denoted by `te`)
* Hindi (denoted by `hi`)
* PTB (denoted by `ptb`)

All these datasets are compatible with [SRILM](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/). Files marked with `unk` have replaced all singletons with `<unk>` tokens. Files marked with `char` are character versions. All datasets have a `train`, `valid` and `test` file. You will find the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Y_SiDYwIObaE52dmZ0YVFXckU/view?usp=sharing).
